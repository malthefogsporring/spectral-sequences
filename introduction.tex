\section{Introduction}
This is an informal and evolving set of notes on spectral sequences. The goal is to flesh out details and complete exercises from the reference material, mainly \cite{Hatcher-spec} and \cite{McCleary}, with a particular focus on applications to computing homotopy groups of spheres. Higher categorical formalism will be emphasised where possible. After setting up the common construction of spectral sequences, we will start with the Serre spectral sequence, mostly as it is a classical and relatively simple spectral sequence, ideal for getting comfortable with the calculus of spectral sequences. We will then focus on the Adams and Adams-Novikov sequences, which remain some of the most powerful computational tools available to date, particularly for computing stable homotopy groups of spheres.
