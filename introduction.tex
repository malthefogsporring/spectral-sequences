\section{Introduction}
This is an informal and evolving set of notes on spectral sequences. The goal is to flesh out details and complete exercises from the reference material, mainly \cite{Hatcher-spec} and \cite{McCleary}, with a particular focus on applications to computing homotopy groups of spheres. After setting up the common construction of spectral sequences, we will start with the Serre spectral sequence, a classical and relatively simple spectral sequence ideal for getting comfortable with the calculus of spectral sequences. We will then focus on the Adams sequence, which remains one of the most powerful computational tools available for computing stable homotopy groups of spheres.
